    <h1>Hello Internet!</h1>
    <p >Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I work on <strong>HTML</strong> and 
      <strong>CSS</strong> from a <em>terrific</em> class I'm taking as <a href="www.launchschool.com">
        Launch School</a>. I'm learning alot! Why don't you join me?
    </p>
    <p class="more-text">There's not a lot of content on this page as I'm playing around HTML &amp; CSS. When I'm done these last
      two paragraph will take on a lighter colour than the first - the "class" attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; 
      tags and abit of CSS to accomplish that.
    </p>
    <p class="more-text" id="final-paragraph">
    This is the final paragraph. It will also use the `class` attribute as well as the `id` attribute. We'll 
    use some CSS and the `id` attribute to underline the entire paragraph.
