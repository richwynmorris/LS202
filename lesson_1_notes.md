### What is the difference between html and css? 

* Hyper Text Markup Language is used to structure a web page's elements and content. CSS or Cascading Style Sheet is a language concerned primarily with the presentation of the webpage's elements. For example, it's fonts, colours. 

### What are elements? 

* Elements are the designators that define and stucture the content the content of the objects displayed on the page. Elements are defined using the less then and greater than symbols `<>` around the element name. Examples of elements include `<h1>...<h6>`, `<a>`, `<p>` and `<div>`.

### What are tags? 

* Tags are a way to signify the opening and closing of an element. The content defined between the tags will be used as the content for the elements. Tags open using the `<>` syntax with the element between the two symbols. They end using the `</>` syntax with the same element name between them.
